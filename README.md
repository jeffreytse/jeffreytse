<h2>Introduction</h2>

I develop and maintain open-source projects that boost developer productivity.
In addition, I practice playing piano and guitar in my spare time. Besides
that, I also fall in love with photography. Welcome to exchange ideas with me.

Roadmap: 👨‍💻 -> 🎸 -> 🎹 -> 📸

<h2>Support</h2>

🙏 If you use [jekyll-spaceship](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship),
[jekyll-theme-yat](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat),
[jekyll-deploy-action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action),
[zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode),
or any of my other projects, a monthly contribution would mean A WHOLE LOT.

On its own, open-source doesn't pay the bills, and it takes a lot of time to
create and maintain. Hopefully, with your help, continuing my work can be
sustainable and making my new ideas come TRUE 😝.

To thank you for your sponsorship, I will:

- Add you to my BACKERS.md file (>= $0/month).
- Follow your GitHub account (>= $10/month).
- Assist you on using any one of my Open-Source projects ASAP (>= $20/month).
- Notice you when I have new ideas and projects (>= $50/month).
- Add any one of your Ads banner to my profile (>= $100/month).
